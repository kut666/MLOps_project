The project aims to create a model of multiclass drug classification using logistic regression implemented through the PyTorch framework. The data sets available on Kaggle containing information about various narcotic substances are used as data.

Project structure:

`data/drug200.csv`: original dataset
`classification_network.py`: model implemented with PyTorch
`encoder.py`: encoder of categorial features
`my_dataset.py`: create dataloader for a dataset
`train.py`: train and validation model
`infer.py`: inference model

Data:
Dataset about drugs is avaliable on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamtripathi/drug-classification)
