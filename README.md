# Drug classification (MLOps project)

## Task description

The project aims to create a model of multiclass drug classification using logistic regression implemented through the PyTorch framework. The data sets available on Kaggle containing information about various narcotic substances are used as data.

## Setup:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kut666/drug-classification.git
```

2. Setup dependencies via poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

3. Run the train process

```bash
poetry run python train.py
```

4. Run the inference process

```bash
poetry run python infer.py
```

## Data:

Dataset about drugs is avaliable on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamtripathi/drug-classification)
